## Technologies used

Following are the technologies which are used in this application:
Angular 18 (standalone application)
TMDB (for movies listing and searching)
Rxjs (for asychronous data as it is not a complex app so no need for Ngrx State Management)
Firebase (for authentication and hosting)
Angular Routing (for navigation and RouterGuards)
@For and @If (instead of ngfor and ngIf)


## Future plans

Will focus on app optimization using different techniques like lazy loading and infinite scroll. And will also improve styles as needed.
